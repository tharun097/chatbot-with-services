# AI News Summary - Weekly

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants AI news articles summarized in markdown format with specific details. First, I need to parse each article's content to extract the date, summary, and source URL. 

Starting with the first article: the content mentions a future date, 2025, and AI's impact on Indian agriculture. The date provided is Tue, 30 Sep 2025. The summary should highlight the key points like precision farming and yield increase. The URL is given.

Next, another article from the same date but a different source. The summary needs to capture the main innovations mentioned, like AI in agriculture and other tech sectors. The URL is there.

I notice some articles have similar dates. I need to sort them by date, latest first. The latest date I see is October 4, 2025. That article talks about tech news, including privacy battles and AI misuse. I'll note the date, summary, and URL.

I need to check each date carefully. For example, an article from October 6, 2025, is listed, so that should be the latest. However, the user's provided articles have dates up to October 3, 2025. Wait, the last article in the provided list is from October 3, 2025. But the user's own date in the example is 2025, which is in the future. That's a bit confusing, but I'll proceed with the given dates.

I also need to ensure the summaries are concise. For instance, the article about Anthropic's new model should mention the model's capabilities and the source. 

I should watch out for duplicate entries. For example, some articles from the same date might have similar content. I need to make sure each summary is unique and captures the main points without overlap.

Another thing is the date formatting. The user wants the date in IST in YYYY-MM-DD format. So converting the given dates (which are in GMT) to IST (UTC+5:30) would require adding 5.5 hours. For example, an article dated Tue, 30 Sep 2025 08:02:00 GMT would be 13:32:00 IST the same day, so the date remains 2025-09-30. If the GMT time is late at night, adding 5.5 hours might roll the date over, but most of these are in the morning or afternoon, so the date should stay the same.

I'll process each article one by one, extract the required info, convert dates to IST, and then sort them from latest to earliest. Finally, format them as markdown with the specified structure.
