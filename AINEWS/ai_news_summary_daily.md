# AI News Summary - Daily

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to summarize AI-related news articles into a markdown format with specific guidelines. First, I need to parse each article's content, date, and URL. The dates are in GMT, so I'll convert them to IST, which is UTC+5:30. 

Looking at the first article, the date is Mon, 06 Oct 2025 06:32:47 GMT. Adding 5:30 hours, that becomes 11:32 IST. The article talks about Private 5G, AI/ML, digital twins, and India's market growth. I need a concise summary highlighting key points like the projected market size and growth rates.

Next, the second article from gicpdt.com mentions AI education institutions. The date is 09:20 GMT, so 14:30 IST. I should note the emphasis on self-paced learning and the role of institutions like GICPDT.

The third article about Bitcoin and Qualcomm's AI move has a date of 08:35 GMT, converting to 14:05 IST. The key points here are Qualcomm's switch to Arm's architecture and the broader tech trends mentioned.

HCLTech's recognition by TIME Magazine is next. The date here is 14:18 GMT, which is 19:48 IST. The summary should highlight their dual recognition and rankings.

Then there's the CCI market study on AI and self-audits. The date is 13:31 GMT (19:01 IST). Important to mention the CCI's recommendations and the need for infrastructure upgrades.

The AMD-OpenAI deal is mentioned in several articles. Each has different dates converted to IST. For example, the Reuters article is at 10:54 GMT (16:24 IST). The key is to highlight the multi-year deal, financial aspects, and AMD's position against Nvidia.

Other articles like the Indeed survey on job changes due to AI, healthcare AI guardrails, and AMD stock performance also need concise summaries with converted IST dates.

I need to ensure each summary is a concise sentence, include the IST date, and sort them from latest to oldest. Also, check for duplicate content. For instance, multiple articles mention the AMD-OpenAI deal, so I should consolidate them to avoid repetition, maybe picking the most detailed one.

Finally, verify all URLs are correctly linked and the markdown format is correct. Make sure the dates are correctly converted and formatted as YYYY-MM-DD. Also, check that each entry is in descending order by date.
